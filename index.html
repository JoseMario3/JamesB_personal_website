            Hi! My name is James Bosch. I am currently a student at CUNY Lehman College
            in Bronx pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I am also a competitive gamer and
            active participant in the "Fighting Game Community." I've hosted many local game
            tournaments and gatherings in the mid-Hudson Valley region of NY. I'm a tech
            enthusiast that's interested in many facets of technology. I have years of experience
            building PCs, including custom water cooling.
        </p>
